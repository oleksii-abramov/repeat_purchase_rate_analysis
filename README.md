## How many days pass between the first and second order?

Overall, it takes **314 days in median** for customers to make a second purchase.

### 2020
In **2020**, the majority of customers made their second order **between 400 and 1100 days**, with a **median of 765 days**.

The **high-value group** made purchases more evenly over time, with a **median of 671 days**. Other groups typically made their second purchase after around **350 days**, with a **median of 783 days for the medium-value group** and **820 days for the low-value group**.

### 2021
In **2021**, the majority of customers made their second order **before 600 days**, with a **median of 373 days**.

The **high-value group** in most cases made a second purchase **before 400 days**, after which there was a significant drop, with a **median of 261 days**.

The **medium-value group** made purchases relatively evenly **until around 650 days**, after which the number gradually decreased. The **median for this group is 399 days**.

The **low-value group** generally made their second purchase **between 350 and 600 days**, with a **median of 529 days**.

### 2022
In **2022**, the majority of customers made their second purchase **before the 400-day mark**, with a **median of 224 days**, after which there was a significant drop.

For the **high-value group**, there is a gradual decline in purchases **up to around 350 days**, followed by a sharp drop. The **median is 177 days**.

The **medium-value group** shows a gradual decline **up to around 450 days**, followed by a sharp drop, with a **median of 243 days**.

Most of the **low-value group** made their second purchase **between 350 and 500 days**, with a **median of 406 days**.

### Key Insight
The time between the first and second purchase **decreases significantly from 2020 to 2022**, especially for **high-value customers**, suggesting improved customer retention over time.

## What is the repeat purchase rate?

Overall, **18.32% of customers repurchased**, with the majority of repeat purchases occurring within the **6–12 month period**.

### 2020
In **2020**, **5.44%** of customers repurchased. The **high-value group** had the highest rate at **13.46%**, while the **medium-value** and **low-value groups** had **3.76%** and **0.79%**, respectively.

All groups showed peak in repeat purchase rate around the **6–12 month period**, except for the low-value group, where the rate remained relatively consistent across all periods.

### 2021
In **2021**, the repeat purchase rate increased to **19.84%**. The **high-value group** led with **39.02%**, followed by the **medium-value group** at **18.06%**, and the **low-value group** at **4.20%**.

All groups showed that the majority of repeat purchases occurred within the **6–12 month period**.

### 2022
In **2022**, the repeat purchase rate further increased to **21.88%**. The **0–6 month period** showed growth compared to 2021, while the **6–12 month period** was slightly lower.

The **high-value group** reached **42.08%**, the **medium-value group** **20.47%**, and the **low-value group** **4.48%**.

Most repeat purchases **peaked in the 6–12 month period**.

### Key Insight
The repeat purchase rate **grew significantly from 2020 to 2022**, driven primarily by **high-value customers**, while the **6–12 month period** consistently remains the key window for repeat purchases.

# Conclusions and Recommendations

Customer retention improved significantly from 2020 to 2022, both in terms of repeat purchase rate and time to second purchase.

The repeat purchase rate increased from **5.44% in 2020** to **21.88% in 2022**, while the time between the first and second order decreased from a median of **765 days to 224 days**. This indicates that customers are returning both **more frequently and faster** over time.

High-value customers consistently outperform other customer groups, showing the **highest repeat purchase rates** and the **shortest time to second purchase**. By 2022, their repeat rate reached **42.08%**, with a median return time of **177 days**. 

They are also the primary driver of revenue: while representing around **25% of all customers**, they consistently generate **over 60% of total revenue** each year.

Across all years, the **6–12 month period** remains the most critical window for repeat purchases.

At the same time, low-value customers show relatively weak retention, with low repeat rates and longer return times, indicating an opportunity for targeted engagement and conversion strategies.

### Recommendations

- Focus retention efforts on the **first 6–12 months** after the initial purchase  
- Prioritize **high-value customers** as the main driver of revenue  
- Analyze customer behavior before and during the repeat purchase stage  
- Develop strategies to **convert low-value and medium-value customers** into repeat buyers
